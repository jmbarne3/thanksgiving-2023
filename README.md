My obsidian vault for thanksgiving

## Purpose
This was my first attempt to organize a meal plan within an Obsidian vault. The last minute nature of its creation, and my own proclivity towards printed plans and recipes for cooking made it not as useful as I thought it might be as a day-of organization tool. However, I think the tagging capabilities within Obsidian make it a useful tool for organizing and keeping recipes, and I plan to try using it as a permanent store for my recipes in another repository.
